Note that this call can view at most 250 lines at a time and 200 lines minimum. When using this tool to gather information, it's your responsibility to ensure you have the COMPLETE context. Specifically, each time you call this command you should: 1) Assess if the contents you viewed are sufficient to proceed with your task. 2) Take note of where there are lines not shown. 3) If the file contents you have viewed are insufficient, and you suspect they may be in lines not shown, proactively call the tool again to view those lines. 4) When in doubt, call this tool again to gather more information. Remember that partial file views may miss critical dependencies, imports, or functionality. In some cases, if reading a range of lines is not enough, you may choose to read the entire file. Reading entire files is often wasteful and slow, especially for large files (i.e. more than a few hundred lines). So you should use this option sparingly.
